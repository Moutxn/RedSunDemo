 - If you have this .txt, it means you are playing the Demo. I will do a TL;DR of what is important:


 > This mod is Luigi only. Use the SaveFile already in the mod and play as Luigi - do NOT do a new SaveFile and do NOT play with Mario on that SaveFile. It is impossible to play with
  Mario (you will die in the Prologue) and every Dome, except Dome 1, has Death Areas.

 > Talking about Death Areas, every Hungry Luma galaxies (even the Terrace one) and every Dome that isn't the Terrace has a Death Area under it: it impossible to go in any of them.

  -> As such, know that this mod includes these Galaxies/levels only:
   * Gateway.
   * Good Egg 1, 2, 3 and C.
   * Gusty Garden 1, 2, 3, S and C.
   * Rolling Green 1, 2, S1 and S2.
   * Robot Reactor 1, 2, S1 and S2.

 > This Demo is 18 Stars. Do NOT take Robot Reactor 1 (the Grand Star) as your 13th Star, as it will crash your game. You are warned.

 > Matter Splatter is unlockable, but going into it will kill you again and again, soft-locking you in a never-ending death loop; you will need to restart the mod if you go there.
  You deserve to get soft-locked if you go into a Galaxy I told you not to go to.

 > Lastly, I would ask you NOT to go to with Mario and check the Galaxies orders and the names of Dome 2 and Dome 3. I know it's tempting, but I would be happy if you don't.


 Nothing else to say. Everything you might need is in the .txt in the folder. Have fun and stray strong!
