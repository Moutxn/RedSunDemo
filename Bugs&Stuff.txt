 [IMPORTANT ONES!!]





 [OVERALL]





 [GALAXIES/WORLD MAP]

  -> Some Galaxies won't unlock for a bit (some Lumas won't show themselves until you get the Green Stars, some galaxies are unlocked only when you do a level of a Galaxy way later,
 stuff like that...). While it can be considered a bug, every galaxy of the game will unlock at some point, don't worry.

  -> The music in Beach Bowl C acts a bit weird - as it's funny, I don't plan on trying to fix it.




 [GALAXIES/STARS]

  -> Taking the Dome 1 Grand Star as your 13rd Star will make the game crash.
