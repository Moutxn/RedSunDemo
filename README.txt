 - "Super Kaizo Galaxy 1: Red Sun" is a mod that acts as a prequel of "Super Kaizo Galaxy 2: Blue Eclipse". It can be played before or after, or even if you don't plan on playing on
  Blue Eclipse. It is a Kaizo mod, like the name suggests - as such, the levels will be way more difficult, some glitches, tricks and precision will be needed!
   > This mod is meant to be played with Luigi and 2P. You won't be able to play this mod if you can't play around 2P. If you need help on setting up 2P, you can ask how to do it.
  You can either do it alone or, if you want "some fun", you can try with someone else doing 2P - if you try this, though, I wish you good, good luck. Like, really.


 *GENERAL STUFF:

 - THIS HACK IS A LUIGI-ONLY MOD!!! If you play Mario, you WON'T BE ABLE TO BEAT MOST GALAXIES. There is NO REASON to even chose him in the first place - it also makes no sense
  lore-wise. Play with the save file offered to you.

 - Make sure you can play with 2P. Not all levels needs 2P and not all tricks are about it, but you won't even be able to leave the first level without it.

 - Crystal Floating is *NOT* needed for ANY Star of my hack! Slope climbing will be needed for some tricks, though. Mega sideflips, zip jumps or any trick that is way too
  inconsistent without a TAS are NOT needed!

 - Crystal Floating and any form of adding things to levels is not allowed. For a good challenge, please use the less save states you can - if you feel like you need
  them, feel free to use them - as long as you have fun. They are not considered CHEATING, as my mod should still be challenging! 




 *TO BE WARNED OF:

 - If you move a Comet with the help of the Purple Luma, it could put it in a faraway place, meaning you can't do that Comet. Comets are in general very weird in my mod,
  so try to not play around them and let me spawn normally.

 - Some galaxies/stars could be unlockable until you beat a certain Star (hard-coded stuff) - don't worry about it too much if you see a Galaxy that doesn't unlock while you have
  enough Stars for it.




 *WARNINGS:

 - Do NOT take the Grand Star of Dome 1 as your 13rd Star.
